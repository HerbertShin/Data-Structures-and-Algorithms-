Data structures and algorithms I have learned through school and personal research. 

# Recursive-ArrayList
A recursive algorithm is implemented into an array list to convert from decimal to binary by dividing the decimal by 2. If the remainder is a number between 0-1 then a one is added to the list. If the remainder is 0, a 0 is added into the list but if a negative number is inputted an exception is thrown and caught with a message. 

# DoublyLinkedListProjects - LinearSearchAndSort
The user is asked to input any amount of numbers which is stored and sorted in an array list. The array list is then converted into a doubly linked list allowing for any need to linearly traverse through the list.

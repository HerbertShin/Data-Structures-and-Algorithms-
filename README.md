Data structures and algorithms I have learned through school and personal research. 

#ArrayList Data Structure Example
The decimal to binary converter uses an array list data structure to continuously loop until an accepted value runs through the base case. I learned how array lists act similarily to queues since the first value appeneded is moved to the last element.

# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms I have learned through school and personal research. 

# Recursive-ArrayList
A recursive algorithm is implemented into an array list to convert from decimal to binary by dividing the decimal by 2. If the remainder is a number between 0-1 then a one is added to the list. If the remainder is 0, a 0 is added into the list but if a negative number is inputted an exception is thrown and caught with a message. 

# DoublyLinkedListProjects - LinearSearchAndSort
The user is asked to input any amount of numbers which is stored and sorted in an array list. The array list is then converted into a doubly linked list allowing for any need to linearly traverse through the list.

# PriorityQueue
Implemented a priority queue to create a clinic entry registration system. The user is asked a series of prompts to input a name, urgency(regular visit/emergency), and if it is an emergency then the user is asked to rate the emergency from a scale of 1-10. The program then uses a comparator to compare key values of the patients who inputted their visit as an emergency. The patient with an emergency is immediately placed ahead of patients with a regular visit and each emergency is sorted in the queue aswell. After a patient registers, the time is logged where regular patients can be then sorted using times of registration.
